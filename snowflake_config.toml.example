# Snowflake Configuration File Example
# Copy this file to 'snowflake_config.toml' and replace with your actual credentials
# Get these from: Profile Icon → Account → View Account Details → Download Config

[connections.my_example_connection]
account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
authenticator = "externalbrowser"
role = "YOUR_ROLE"
warehouse = "YOUR_WAREHOUSE"
database = "YOUR_DATABASE"
schema = "YOUR_SCHEMA"

# Notes:
# - You can literally copy-paste the config from Snowflake
# - Set warehouse/database/schema to your preferences (or leave as "<none selected>")
# - For password auth, add: password = "your_password_here"
# - Browser auth (externalbrowser) is more secure and supports SSO/MFA
