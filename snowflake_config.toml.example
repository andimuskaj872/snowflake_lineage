# Snowflake Configuration File Example
# Copy this file to 'snowflake_config.toml' and replace with your actual credentials
# Get these from: Profile Icon → Account → View Account Details → Download Config

# Option 1: SSO/Browser Authentication (Recommended - Most Secure)
# Supports SSO, MFA, and federated authentication
[connections.my_example_connection]
account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
authenticator = "externalbrowser"
role = "YOUR_ROLE"
warehouse = "YOUR_WAREHOUSE"
database = "YOUR_DATABASE"
schema = "YOUR_SCHEMA"

# Option 2: Password Authentication (Traditional)
# Uncomment the section below and comment out the SSO section above to use password auth
# [connections.my_example_connection]
# account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
# user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
# password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
# role = "YOUR_ROLE"
# warehouse = "YOUR_WAREHOUSE"
# database = "YOUR_DATABASE"
# schema = "YOUR_SCHEMA"

# Quick Setup Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to 'snowflake_config.toml'
# 2. Choose authentication method (SSO recommended)
# 3. Replace YOUR_* placeholders with actual values
# 4. For SSO: Remove/comment password line, keep authenticator = "externalbrowser"
# 5. For Password: Remove/comment authenticator line, add password line

# Tips:
# - You can copy-paste the config directly from Snowflake's profile settings
# - Set warehouse/database/schema to your preferences (or leave as "<none selected>")
# - SSO auth opens a browser window for secure login with your organization's SSO
# - Password auth works but doesn't support MFA or SSO features
